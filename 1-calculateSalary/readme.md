Programming Challenge - Salary Calculator

Develop a simple software that calculates the employees' wage of a company.

These are the following business rules:
 1. The employees are separated in 3 categories: Developers (DEV), DBAs and Testers.
 2. The amount of wage each employee receives depends on it's role:
    a) Developers receive 10% of salary if they earn more than R$3000,00 and 20% if they earn untill R$3000,00.
    b) DBAs and Testers receive 15% of salary if they earn more than R$3000,00 and 20% if they earn untill R$3000,00

OBS: It is not necessary to worry about the direct interation with the user. The main focus must be the creation of classes following the good programming practices with emphasis in maintenance, code scalability and flexibility to change/improove new business rules.
